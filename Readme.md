Here’s a basic **README** file for the **Recycling Reward System** frontend project:

# Recycling Reward System Frontend

This project is a frontend interface for interacting with the **Recycling Reward System** smart contract, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to recycle and earn tokens, check their token balances, and lets the contract owner mint tokens.

## Features

- **Connect with MetaMask**: The app connects to the Ethereum blockchain via MetaMask.
- **Recycle and Earn Rewards**: Users can recycle and earn reward tokens based on their actions.
- **Mint Tokens (Admin Only)**: The contract owner can mint new tokens for specific users.
- **Check Token Balance**: Users can check their token balance in the system.

---

## Requirements

- **MetaMask**: A browser extension for managing Ethereum accounts and interacting with decentralized applications.
- **Web3.js**: A JavaScript library to interact with Ethereum smart contracts (included in the project).
- **Ethereum Network**: The contract should be deployed on an Ethereum network (Mainnet, Rinkeby, or any other testnet).

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

You can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/recycling-reward-system-frontend.git
cd recycling-reward-system-frontend
```

### 2. Modify the Frontend Code

Before running the app, update the contract details in the `index.html` file:

- Replace `"YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"` with the actual address where your contract is deployed.
- Ensure that the **contract ABI** matches the one generated when you deployed the smart contract. You can copy the ABI from your smart contract or use tools like **Remix IDE** or **Truffle** to retrieve it.

### 3. Install MetaMask

- **MetaMask** is required to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It is a browser extension that allows you to manage your Ethereum accounts and interact with decentralized applications.
- You can install it from [here](https://metamask.io/).

### 4. Open the Frontend

Once you have everything set up, open the `index.html` file in a web browser that supports **MetaMask** (like **Google Chrome** or **Firefox**).

## How to Use the App

1. **Connect to MetaMask**:

   - Click on the **Connect MetaMask** button to connect your Ethereum wallet.
   - Ensure that your MetaMask is set to the correct Ethereum network where your contract is deployed (Mainnet, Rinkeby, etc.).

2. **Recycle and Earn Tokens**:

   - Enter the amount of recycling (reward units) and click on the **Recycle** button to earn tokens. The contract will emit a `Recycle` event, and you’ll receive reward tokens.

3. **Mint Tokens (Admin Only)**:

   - The contract owner can mint new tokens. Enter a valid Ethereum address and the amount of tokens to mint, and click the **Mint Tokens** button.
   - The tokens will be minted and sent to the specified address.

4. **Check Token Balance**:
   - The app will display the current token balance of the connected user.
   - You can check your balance after performing any action like recycling or minting.

## Smart Contract

The frontend interacts with the following **Recycling Reward System** smart contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract RecyclingRewardSystem {
    string public name = "Recycling Reward Token";
    string public symbol = "RRT";
    uint8 public decimals = 18;

    mapping(address => uint256) private balances;
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    address public owner;

    event Recycle(address indexed user, uint256 rewardAmount);
    event TokensMinted(address indexed to, uint256 amount);

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can mint tokens");
        _;
    }

    function mintTokens(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        require(to != address(0), "Invalid address");
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");

        balances[to] += amount;
        totalSupply += amount;
        emit TokensMinted(to, amount);
    }

    function recycle(uint256 amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");
        emit Recycle(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function balanceOf(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
        return balances[account];
    }
}
```

The contract enables minting tokens (admin-only), recycling actions (rewarding users), and querying token balances.

## Troubleshooting

- **MetaMask Not Detected**: Ensure that MetaMask is installed and enabled in your browser.
- **Incorrect Network**: Make sure you are connected to the correct Ethereum network where the smart contract is deployed (e.g., Mainnet, Rinkeby, or a local test network).
- **Insufficient Gas**: Ensure you have enough ETH in your MetaMask wallet to cover the transaction costs (gas fees).

### Additional Notes

- **Security**: Be cautious when minting tokens, especially on the mainnet. The contract owner should be responsible for minting tokens and managing supply.
- **Improvements**: Future updates could include adding more features like user authentication, tracking recycling statistics, or integrating with IoT devices for real-time recycling tracking.
